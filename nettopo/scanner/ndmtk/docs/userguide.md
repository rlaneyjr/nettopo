# User Guide

Please note that the plugin always collects version and configuration
information when mining for network data.

## Prerequisites

The plugin requires the presence of two binaries:

-   `ssh`
-   `expect`

The users of the plugin should know [YAML](http://yaml.org/)., because
it is the toolkit's abstraction format.

The toolkit works on Linux. However, it could work on Windows too. If
you are interested in Windows support, please open an issue.

## Builtin Commands

This plugin uses the following approach when determining which commands
are availble to run on a remote device.

-   First, each device must carry `ndmtk_os` or `os` attribute. Based on
    the value ofthe attribute, the plugin performs a lookup in
    `files/cli/os/` directory the plugin's directory inside Python's
    `site-packages` directory. For example, Cisco ASA firewall must have
    either `ndmtk_os=cisco_asa` or `os-cisco_asa` attribute.
-   Then, the plugin will try to locate `files/cli/os/cisco_asa.yml`
    file. Once located, the plugin will read it and collect all of the
    cli commands associated with Cisco ASA operating system.

Please note, based on the information, the plugin will also record which
commands show configuration and version information, and which commands
should be used to disable paging or switch to automation mode.

The `disable_defaults` option isables default pre-packages commands for
various operating systems. It is commonly used when configuring a
device, as opposed to gathering data of a device.

## User-Defined Commands

### Per Operating System

The `cliset_os_dir` points to the path to YAML files containing
user-defined commands on per operating system basis. The plugin will run
the commands only if the plugin is able to locate a file matching a
remote host's operating system in this directory.

For example, if a host's operating system is `cisco_nxos`, the plugin
will look for `cisco_nxos.yml` file in this directory. If the file is
found, then the plugin will run the commands it found in the file.

Please note that the plugin runs the commands in addition to any default
commands, unless they are disabled with `disable_defaults`.

The default commands for various operating systems are located in
`<python_site_packages>/ndmtk/files/cli/os` directory.

*****

### Per Individual Host

The `cliset_host_dir` points to the path to YAML files containing
user-defined commands on per host basis. The plugin will run the
commands only if the plugin is able to locate a file matching a remote
host's hostname in this directory.

For example, if a host's hostname is `ny-fw01`, the plugin will look for
`ny-fw01.yml` file in this directory. If the file is present and
readable, then the plugin will run the commands it finds in the file.

Please note that the plugin runs the commands in addition to any default
commands, unless they are disabled with `disable_defaults`.

*****

### Specific Tasks

Frequently, there is a need to run a specific set of commands for
non-data collection purposes, e.g. device configuration. The
`cliset_spec` points to the path to a single YAML file containing
user-defined commands.

As with the previously discussed user-defined commands, the plugin runs
the in addition to any default commands, unless they are disabled with
`disable_defaults`.

:arrow_up: [Back to top](#top)

*****

## Exceptions

The `cliset_exc` points the path to a single YAML file containing
exceptions to both default and user-defined commands. The root element
of the YAML data structure is `exceptions`. The structure is a list of
dictionaries/items. Each dictionary item must have at least one of the
keys: `cli`, `host`, and/or `os`. The keys are strings containing
regular expressions.

The plugin pre-checks each of the commands it has in its queue against
the exceptions. If the plugin matches a command with the `cli` regular
expression, it performs additional `host` and `os` regular expression
searches, if any. If the plugin is able to match all regular expressions
within a single exception, it marks the command as `skipped` and never
runs it on the actual device. By default, the plugin search for
`<ansible_inventory_dir>/files/ndmtk/exceptions.yml` file.

*****

## Limits

A user may limit a scope of the commands from any command line set it
supplies to the plugin. The user could use `sections` option.

For example, if a user wants to run only BGP-related commands on a
device, the user would add the following to a task `sections="bgp"`.
This way, the plugin will only execute the commands that have `bgp` tag
attached to them.

*****

## Data Repository

The plugin uses the value supplied with `output` option to determine
where to store the data produced by the plugin. If a path contains `%`
sign in it, then the plugin performs pre-defined conversions. For
example, `%h` is converted to a host's hostname, `%H` to a host's FQDN,
and `%E` to epoch timestamp. Please search the plugin's source code for
the full list of converted characters.

``` {.sourceCode .py}
'h': 'hostname',
'p': 'unique_process_id',
'U': os.path.split(os.path.expanduser('~'))[-1],
'Y': str(ts.tm_year).zfill(4),
'm': str(ts.tm_mon).zfill(2),
'd': str(ts.tm_mday).zfill(2),
'H': str(ts.tm_hour).zfill(2),
'M': str(ts.tm_min).zfill(2),
'S': str(ts.tm_sec).zfill(2),
'E': str(int(epoch)),
```

## Security

### SSH Fingerprints

If the `no_host_key_check` option is set to `yes`, it instructs the
plugin to accept SSH fingerprints without validation, i.e. trust any SSH
fingerprint.

:arrow_up: [Back to top](#top)

*****

### Jumphosts

The `jumphosts` instructs the plugin to access devices via a chain of
jumphosts. In enterprise networks, access to network devices is allowed
only from restricted management stations/hosts. This option allows users
to run tasks through these hosts.

:arrow_up: [Back to top](#top)

*****

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Recently, enterprise technology users have been moving to multi-factor
authentication (MFA). It presents a challenge to network automation.
However, with `token_bypass` option pointing to the socket of the
process with the knowledge iof what that second (multi) factor is, it is
no longer an issue.

*****

## Examples

The following command instructs Ansible to login to `ny-fw01` and
collect running configuration from it.

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
ansible-playbook playbooks/collect_configuration.yml
```

Alternatively, a user may collect the output of all relevant operating
system commands:

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
ansible-playbook playbooks/collect_all.yml
```

Additionally, this plugin supports Check Mode ("Dry Mode"). In this
mode, the plugin will not attempt to login to network devices. This mode
is used to test for the existence of access credentials.

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
ansible-playbook playbooks/collect_configuration.yml --check
```

Another way to use the plugin is to configure network devices. The below
Ansible playbook configures ACL on a Cisco ASA firewall.

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
ansible-playbook playbooks/configure_acl.yml --check -vvv
ansible-playbook playbooks/configure_acl.yml --vvv
```

This playbook shows how to collecte data via the chaing of devices, i.e
`controller` =\> `10.1.1.1`, `10.1.1.1` =\> `10.1.2.3`, `10.1.2.3` =\>
`10.2.3.4` =\> `managed node`.

``` {.sourceCode .yaml}
- name: data collection via jumphosts
  action: |
     ndmtk output="/tmp/jump-data-%Y%m%d%H%M%S"
     jumphosts="10.1.1.1,10.1.2.3,10.2.3.4"
     no_host_key_check=yes
```

## Common Errors

A user may receive the following error:

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
fatal: [ny-fw01]: FAILED! => {
    "failed": true,
    "msg": "The module ndmtk was not found in configured module paths.
            Additionally, core modules are missing.
            If this is a checkout, run 'git submodule update --init --recursive'
            to correct this problem."
}
```

This is the indication that something is broken with setup.py. The issue
maybe caused by the lack of permissions. Please open an issue.
